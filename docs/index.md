## Clear all settings

"RHarbor.db" exists in the same folder as "RHarbor.exe". This file contains RHarbor's settings you were set.

To initialize the setting please shutdown RHarbor and then delete "RHarbor.db".

New "RHarbor.db" will be generated when you start RHarbor again.

## Notice

### SSH private key file

OpenSSH-format private key files (e.g. generated by `ssh-keygen`) are allowed.

PuTTy format private key files should be converted to OpenSSH format using [puttygen.exe](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html).

RHarbor doesn't care the key file extension.

### Password security

The passwords stored in RHarbor are encrypted but still remains some security risks.

Do not install in a shared computer.

Malicious programs or bad people may read passwords in the database file or in memory.

Please make sure that an appropriate antivirus software is installed on your computer and use on your own risk.
